                <hr>
                <p>Ever since I was a little kid, software development has been my passion. I published my first blog
                    when I was 12 years old. And that was just the start. In next years Ä± when I m studying at
                    university. I met with web programming books at the university library. And I built simple web pages
                    with Html.

                </p>

                <p>Last year I met with python and I m still trying to explore new things for improving myself.
                    Therefore I decided to be a software developer. I did all of this with my passion, as I was said in
                    the beginning.</p>

                <hr>
                <p>As everyone knows, one of the ways to improve yourself is to make theoretical knowledge permanent
                    by practicing.Therefore I created websites.When I'm doing my projects there were too many problems.
                    About security, software,SEO etc.But all of these taught me new things and improved me.</p>

                <p>I can learn just about anything by having a final product to tear apart piece by piece. I break the
                    code where I need to figure out why things work the way they do. Documentation is just a
                    reference.</p>
